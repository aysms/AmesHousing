# AmesHousing
This is one of my class projects conducted in R. My aim was to build linear regression models to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa.
My project focused on comparing between the following 5 linear models: (i) the full model, (ii) the sub-model chosen by AIC, (iii) the sub-model chosen by BIC, (iv) the sub-model chosen by Lasso, and (v) the sub-model chosen by the Elastic Net.
