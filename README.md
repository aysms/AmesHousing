# AmesHousing
This is one of my class projects conducted in R. I aimed to build linear regression models to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa. 
My project focused on comparing the following 5 linear models: (i) the full model, (ii) the sub-model chosen by AIC, (iii) the sub-model chosen by BIC, (iv) the sub-model chosen by Lasso, and (v) the sub-model chosen by the Elastic Net.

The R code file is AmesHousing.R, the raw data is AmesHousing.txt, the data documentation is AmesDataDocumentation.txt, and a brief report including key outputs is AmesHousing_Report.pdf.
